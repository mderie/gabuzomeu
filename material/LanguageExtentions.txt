About the command line parameters
*********************************

- Support big number (we are still ASCII dependant for the "view") :
Allow the input and the output to be bigger than the 255 value, by default we take the 256 modulus
==> False by default
==> Influence instructions PUMP & DUMP
==> Not symmetrical : input as cmdline ok & file ko and output screen ok (still with encoding for np characters) & file ok (no encoding)
==> Anyway the language only know numeric values, not characters !

TODO ?
- Force nibble encoding for NP characters (code between 0 & 31) for input & output files :
Allow file content to be similar as command line
==> False by default
==> Influence instructions PUMP & DUMP

- Next Bird Accessor (arrow operator) : <-< & >->

- ...
